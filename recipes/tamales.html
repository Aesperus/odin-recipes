        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tender masa dough filled with savory shredded chicken in a rich, complex molé sauce, all steamed in corn husks to perfection. A traditional and flavorful Mexican meal for two.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-10 dried corn husks</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked shredded chicken (from about 1 chicken breast or thigh)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ready-made mole sauce (ensure gluten-free and dairy-free if needed)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>11/2 cups masa harina (corn flour specially prepared for tortillas and tamales)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable shortening or lard, at room temperature</li>
            <li>11/4 cup warm chicken broth (or warm water)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Prepare corn husks and chicken filling</h3>
                <p>Soak 8-10 dried corn husks in a large bowl of very hot water for at least 30 minutes, or until they are very flexible and soft. This makes them pliable (flexible and easy to bend) for wrapping. While husks soak, in a small saucepan, combine 1 cup cooked shredded chicken, 1/2 cup ready-made mole sauce (a complex chili sauce, often with nuts, seeds, and chocolate), and 1/4 cup chicken broth. Bring to a gentle simmer (cook gently just below boiling, with small bubbles) over low heat. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce slightly thickens and coats the chicken. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Soaking husks well prevents them from cracking</li>
                    <li>Simmer means to cook gently just below boiling, with small bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Mole is a complex chili sauce.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 30 minutes (inactive) + 10 minutes (active)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Make the masa dough</h3>
                <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups masa harina (corn flour specially prepared for tortillas and tamales), 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In a separate bowl, cream 1/4 cup vegetable shortening or lard until light and fluffy. Gradually add the masa harina mixture to the shortening, alternating with 1 1/4 cups warm chicken broth (or water), mixing until a soft, uniform dough forms. The dough should be light and fluffy. To test, drop a small piece of dough into a glass of cold water; if it floats, it is ready. If it sinks, beat in a little more broth or water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it floats.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Masa harina is a special corn flour for tamales.</li>
                    <li>The float test ensures the masa is light and airy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 15 minutes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Assemble the tamales</h3>
                <p>Drain the softened corn husks and pat them dry. Choose the widest, unbroken husks. Lay one husk flat with the wider end at the top. Spread about 2-3 tablespoons of the prepared masa dough evenly over the wider half of the husk, leaving a 1-inch border at the top and sides. Spoon 1-2 tablespoons of the chicken mole filling down the center of the masa. Fold the sides of the corn husk over the filling, then fold the narrow bottom end up. Leave the top open. Repeat with remaining husks, masa, and filling. You should get 4-6 tamales.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not overfill the tamales, or they will be difficult to fold.</li>
                    <li>Folding neatly ensures even steaming.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 20 minutes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Steam the tamales</h3>
                <p>Set up a steamer pot: fill the bottom with water (do not let it touch the steamer basket) and bring to a boil. Arrange the tamales upright in the steamer basket, with the open end facing up. Do not pack them too tightly, allowing steam to circulate. Cover the steamer and steam for 45-60 minutes, or until the masa separates easily from the corn husk. This means the tamales are cooked through. If water levels get low during steaming, carefully add more boiling water to the pot.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steaming cooks the tamales gently and thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>The tamale is done when the masa separates cleanly from the husk.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 45-60 minutes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Serve</h3>
                <p>Carefully remove the cooked tamales from the steamer. Let them cool for a few minutes before unwrapping and serving. Garnish with fresh cilantro, sliced red onion, or a dollop of Mexican crema (ensure dairy-free alternative if needed) if desired.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Letting tamales rest briefly helps them firm up.</li>
                    <li>They are best enjoyed warm.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 5 minutes (inactive)</p>
