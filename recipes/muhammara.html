        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A flavorful and vibrant Middle Eastern dip made from roasted red bell peppers and walnuts, blended with tangy pomegranate molasses and spices. Served with warm pita bread, it is perfect as an appetizer for two.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large red bell peppers</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (60g) of walnuts</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons gluten-free breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses (a thick, tangy syrup made from pomegranate juice)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water (for thinning, if needed)</li>
            <li>2 warm pita breads, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Roast the bell peppers</h3>
                <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place 2 large red bell peppers on a baking sheet. Roast for 20-25 minutes, turning them halfway through, until the skins are softened and slightly charred (lightly browned and blackened in spots). Alternatively, you can char them over an open flame on a gas stove or under a broiler (cook under a top heating element). Once roasted, transfer the hot peppers to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap or a lid for 10-15 minutes. This steaming helps loosen the skins. Once cool enough to handle, peel the skins off the peppers, remove the stems and seeds. Chop the roasted pepper flesh roughly. Broil means to cook food directly under a high heat source.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Charring adds a smoky flavor to the peppers.</li>
                    <li>Steaming helps make peeling easier.</li>                    
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 25 minutes (active roasting) + 15 minutes (inactive steaming)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Toast walnuts and combine ingredients</h3>
                <p>While peppers steam, toast 1/2 cup walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring often, until fragrant (smells pleasant and aromatic). Be careful not to burn them. Let them cool. In a food processor, combine the chopped roasted red bell peppers, toasted walnuts, 2 tablespoons gluten-free breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses (a thick, tangy syrup made from pomegranate juice), 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Fragrant means it smells good and aromatic.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toasting walnuts enhances their flavor and crunch.</li>
                    <li>Pomegranate molasses is a key ingredient for the sweet and tangy flavor of Muhammara.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 5 minutes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Blend the muhammara</h3>
                <p>Process all ingredients in the food processor until they form a coarse paste. Do not blend until completely smooth; Muhammara (a red pepper and walnut dip) should have a slightly textured consistency. If the mixture is too thick, add 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency. Taste and adjust salt or lemon juice if needed.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blending to a coarse paste provides a pleasant texture.</li>
                    <li>Adjust consistency by adding water gradually.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 3 minutes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Serve</h3>
                <p>Transfer the Muhammara to a serving bowl. Drizzle with a little extra olive oil. Serve immediately or chill for flavors to meld. Serve with 2 warm pita breads (flatbreads), cut into wedges. The pita bread makes the dish no longer gluten-free.</p>
                <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Muhammara tastes even better after chilling for a few hours as flavors deepen.</li>
                    <li>Pita is a type of flatbread.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Estimated time: 1 minute</p>
